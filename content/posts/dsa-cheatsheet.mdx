## Sliding window

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{ latex: "$$O(n)$$" }}
  sc={{
    latex: (
      <ul>
        <li>\(O(1)\) if only 2 pointers tracked</li>
        <li>\(O(w)\) if window elements tracked</li>
      </ul>
    ),
  }}
/>

Maintain a **dynamic window** that slides through the array or string, adjusting its boundaries as needed to track relevant elements or characters.

Convert **multiple nested loops into single loop**, reducing the time complexity from $O(n²)$ or $O(n³)$ to $O(n)$.

#### Types

- **Fixed window size**
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays
    With Length K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k/description/)
- **Variable window size**
  - Approach:
    - **Initialize window indices**: Start with `start` and `end` pointers at the first element.
    - **Expand the window**: Increment the `end` pointer to expand the window if conditions are met.
    - **Process the window**: Perform required operations when the window meets criteria.
    - **Adjust the window size**: Move the `start` pointer to adjust size and meet desired criteria.

- **Multiple windows**: Maintaining overlapping or disjoint windows can help solve problems more efficiently.
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Hard" /> [992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/editorial/)

#### When to use

- **Contiguous** data: array, linked list, string, or stream
- Processing subsets of elements: The problem requires repeated computations on a **contiguous subset** of data elements (a subarray or a substring) of **fixed** or **variable** length
- Find longest, shortest or target values of a sequence

#### Problem patterns

1. **Running Average**: Efficiently calculate the average of a fixed-size window in a data stream.
1. **Formulating Adjacent Pairs**: Process adjacent pairs in an ordered structure for easy access and operation.
1. **Target Value Identification**: Adjust window size to search efficiently for specific values or subarrays.
1. **Longest/Shortest/Most Optimal Sequence**: Identify the desired sequence in a collection by sliding a window through it.

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is **no limit** on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- **Starting from any tree** of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked `fruits` **must** fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must **stop**.
- Given the integer array `fruits`, return the **maximum number** of `fruits` you can pick.

                basket.add(fruits[right])
                right += 1

## Intervals

<AlgorithmSummary tc={{ latex: "$$O(n)$$" }} sc={{ latex: "$$O(1)$$" }} />

Typical interval problem deals with **array of overlapping intervals** e.g. `[[1, 3], [3, 5]]`

Common tasks with intervals:

- Merging intersecting intervals
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)
- Inserting new intervals into existing sets
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/)
- Schedule tasks
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/description/)
- Arrange meeting rooms
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/description/)
- Determining the minimum number of intervals needed to cover a given range

#### Corner cases

- No intervals
- Single interval
- Two intervals
- Non-overlapping intervals
- An interval totally consumed within another interval
- Duplicate intervals (exactly the same start and end)
- Intervals which start right where another interval ends - `[[1, 2], [2, 3]]`

#### When to use

- Given intervals
- Find union / intersection / gaps

  }}
>

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the start and the end of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (**merge** overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

</Problem>

Problem can be dropped down into 2 subproblems:

1. Find correct place for `newInterval`
   - Since `intervals` is sorted, we can utilize binary search.
2. Merge it with any overlapping intervals
   - Linear iteration over intervals

        n = len(intervals)
        target = newInterval[0]
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        while left <= right:

You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a **constraint**:
There has to be a gap of at least `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the **minimum number** of CPU intervals required to complete all `tasks`.

## Greedy

### Sometimes we can do the things retrospectively:

- [1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://leetcode.com/problems/furthest-building-you-can-reach/description/) - Setting all the ladders and than retrospectively substitute them with bricks:

```py
class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
        pq = []
        for i in range(len(heights) - 1):
            delta = heights[i + 1] - heights[i]
            if delta <= 0:
                continue
            if ladders:
                ladders -= 1
                heappush(pq, delta)
            elif bricks >= delta or (pq and bricks >= pq[0]):
                top = heappushpop(pq, delta)
                bricks -= top
            else:
                return i
        return len(heights) - 1
```

- [134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/) - On each iteration: Check the furthest you can go with current gas. Remember where max gas was. If current gas is empty, retrospectively load tank with gas from max station.

```py
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        cur_gas = 0
        total_gas = 0
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            cur_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if cur_gas < 0:
                cur_gas = 0
                ans = i + 1
        if total_gas < 0:
            return -1
        return ans
```

## Dijkstra's shortest path

#### Description

1. Set `distances` from initial node to each node: `0` to initial, `Infinity` to others
2. Init `Priority queue` `pq` to store potential min nodes
3. While `pq`:
   1. Pop nim node from `pq`
   2. Set all adjacent nodes `new distance = cur distance (it's minimal) + edge distances`. Set only if it's less than current adjacent node distance
   3. Add all adjacent nodes to `pq` with updated distances

#### Finding path

Backtrack from end node to start node:

1. On each iteration pick adjacent nodes to current
2. Set current to minimal
3. Add new node to result array
4. Return reversed array

Instead of backtracking, we can set `parent` nodes during main Dijkstra's algorithm. When it's finished:

1. Pick end node
2. Iteratively go to parent and remember current node (push it to result array)
3. return reversed array

## Dynamic Programming

Resources:

- [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/gold/intro-dp?lang=py)
- [Miro board with examples](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKsh2Zg4=/)

**Dynamic programming** is a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution.

#### Why use DP?

- The problem can be divided by subproblems
- The subproblems are overlapping

#### 3 main components:

1. **State** - stores answer for i-th subproblem
2. **Transition between states** - how to get new solution based on previously calculated
3. **Base case**

#### Approaches

- **Top-Down** - try to solve main problem first, and to solve it solve subproblems recursively up to base case
- **Bottom-Up** - solve subproblems starting from the next one to base case and finishing on main problem

---

- **Push DP** - update future states based on the current state
- **Pull DP** - calculate the current state based on past states

#### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up

**Top-Down**

- Benefits: Easier to implement because of recursion
- Drawbacks: Could not be appliciable because of call stack overflow

**Bottom-Up**

- Benefits: No recursion. Sometimes is better in space than Top-Down
- Drawbacks: Harder to implement

#### Hints on using DP

- Think of Base case
- First try recursive Top-Bottom
- Then if Top-Bottom doesn't fit (because of recursive stack or to optimise space, or whatsoever) then try Bottom-Up

## Traversals

1. **DFS** (Depth First Search) - search in depth

- **Preorder** - Used to clone tree
- **Inorder** - Used to travense tree in BFS order (when traversing over BST, print nodes in sorted order)
- **Postorder** - Used to delete tree

2. **BFS** (Breadth First Search) - search neighbors first
1. **DLS** (Depth Limited Search) - DFS but with limited depth
1. **IDDFS** (Iterative Deepening Depth First Search) - DLS with increasing depth limit (1, 2, 3, ...) until target is found

## Matrix

[Miro 🔗](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLeqOC3Q=/?share_link_id=441000358084)

**Problems with matrices**

1. Traverse in some order - [Spiral matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/description/)
2. Transform matrix - [Rotate image (matrix rotation)](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/)
3. Traverse on matrix as Graph (DFS, BFS, others) - [The Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/description/)
4. DP on matrix - [Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/description/)

## Bonus

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

**Euclidean method** [🔗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

This method is based on the principle:

> GCD doesn't change if we replace bigger number by difference of 2 numbers: `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a - b, b)`
> To make finding more efficient, `a - b` is changed to `a % b`:
