## Time and Space Complexity. Big O Notation

#### Time Complexity

Indicated **how fast** algorithm computing time grows when input size grows.

When solving problems, we can compare algorithm **Time Complexity** to input size and validate if given algorithm fits to input size.

**Example**
$\newcommand\computeTime{0.25 \times 10^{-9}\frac{seconds}{operation}}$

- $O(n!)$ - Time Complexity
- $4 \text{ GHz}$ - Processor single-core speed

Actual time taken

- How much time it takes for 1 operation computed on $4 \text{ GHz}$ single-core processor $\rightarrow$ $4 \text{ GHz} = 4 \times 10^9 \frac{operations}{second} $ $\rightarrow$ $ \computeTime$
- If maximum `n = 8` → $8! = 40320$ $\rightarrow 40320 \times \computeTime$ $= 1.008×10^{−5}$ seconds. So, computer will be able to compute it in reasonable time.
- If maximum `n = 100` → $100! = $  number with 158 digits $\rightarrow 100! \times \computeTime$ $\approx$ $3 \times 10^{150}$ **years**. This is $\approx 2.14 \times 10^{140}$ times longer than our universe 🪐 exists!

#### Big O Notation

Analyzes asymptotic - answers for fast function grows

Associates problem size `n` with processing time to solve problem `t`

#### Best, Worst, and Average Cases

- **Best**: Function performs minimal operations required to solve problem on input of `n` elements
- **Worst**: Maximum amount of steps required to solve problem on input of `n` elements
- **Average** Average amount of steps required to solve problem on input of `n` elements

> In real-time computing, the **worst-case** execution time is often of particular concern since it is important to know how much time might be needed in the worst case to **guarantee** that the algorithm will always finish on time.

<div align="right">
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best,_worst_and_average_case)
</div>

#### Example - [Bogosort (Permutation sort)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)

Bogosort creates permutation of input array and checks if it's sorted.

- **Best**: $O_{best}(n)$ - array initially sorted, so it's needed **n** operations to check if each element on right place
- **Worst**: $O_{worst}(\infty)$ - since bogosort creates random permutation each time, in worst case it will never produce sorted permutation
- **Average** $O_{avg}(n \times n!)$ - amount of permutations is $n!$

#### Order of Magnitude

A description of a function in terms of big $ O $ notation typically provides only an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.

To calculate Order of Magnitude:

- **Discard constants**:

  - $ 3n^2 + 5 \to n^2 $

- **Pick only the most significant function**:
  - $ n^2 + 2n + 1 \to n^2 $

#### Typical Operations with Big O Notation

- **Adding** two functions or complexities
  - $ O(n) + O(m) \to O(n + m)$ $\text{or}\;O(\max(n, m)) $
- **Multiplying** two functions or complexities
  - $ O(n) \times O(m) \to O(n \times m) $

#### Space Complexity

Space complexity measures the memory required by an algorithm as a function of the input size

In Big $ O $ notation, common space complexities include:

- $ O(1) $ for constant space
- $ O(n) $ for linear space, and
- $ O(n^2) $ for quadratic space.

Optimizing Space complexity can lead to more efficient algorithms, especially in **large-scale** data processing.

    With Length K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-distinct-subarrays-with-length-k/description/)
- **Variable window size**
  - Approach:
    - **Initialize window indices**: Start with `start` and `end` pointers at the first element.
    - **Expand the window**: Increment the `end` pointer to expand the window if conditions are met.
    - **Process the window**: Perform required operations when the window meets criteria.
    - **Adjust the window size**: Move the `start` pointer to adjust size and meet desired criteria.

}}
>
You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two** baskets, and each basket can only hold a **single type** of fruit. There is **no limit** on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- **Starting from any tree** of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked `fruits` **must** fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must **stop**.
- Given the integer array `fruits`, return the **maximum number** of `fruits` you can pick.

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where <code>intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> represent the start and the end of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code>. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (**merge** overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

</Problem>

Problem can be dropped down into 2 subproblems:

1. Find correct place for `newInterval`
   - Since `intervals` is sorted, we can utilize binary search.
2. Merge it with any overlapping intervals
   - Linear iteration over intervals

```py filename="57. Insert Interval"
class Solution:
    def insert(
        self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]
    ) -> List[List[int]]:
        # If the intervals vector is empty, return a vector containing the newInterval
        if not intervals:
            return [newInterval]

        n = len(intervals)
        target = newInterval[0]
        left, right = 0, n - 1

        # Binary search to find the position to insert newInterval
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if intervals[mid][0] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        # Insert newInterval at the found position
        intervals.insert(left, newInterval)

        # Merge overlapping intervals
        res = []
        for interval in intervals:
            # If res is empty or there is no overlap, add the interval to the result
            if not res or res[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                res.append(interval)
            # If there is an overlap, merge the intervals by updating the end of the last interval in res
            else:
                res[-1][1] = max(res[-1][1], interval[1])

You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a **constraint**:

## Linked List

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{
    latex: (
      <ul>
        <li>\(Insert, Remove - O(1)\)</li>
        <li>\(Get\;by\;index, Search - O(n)\)</li>

This section focuses on **in-place** operations with Linked Lists.

#### Properties

- Sequential data structure (like array, unlike tree)
- Slow access, but fast add / delete operations

#### Types

- Singly-linked list
- Doubly-linked list
- Circular-linked list

#### Example of Linked List

```py filename="Typical ListNode in LeetCode"
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

first_node = ListNode(1)
second_node = ListNode(2)

first_node.next = second_node
```

```py
┌─────┐    ┌─────┐
│  1  ┼───►│  2  ┼───x
└─────┘    └─────┘
```

#### Dummy node technique

If operation is going to be performed on head or tail node, we can create `dummy` node, and point `dummy.next` to `head`. It helps not to handle edge cases for head only:

```py filename="dummy node usage example"
dummy = ListNode()
dummy.next = head

# perform operations on dummy.next
# we don't need to handle head specifically

return dummy.next
```

#### Typical operations with Linked Lists

  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Hard" /> [460. LFU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lfu-cache/description/)

#### When to use

- **Linked list restructuring**: The input data is given as a linked list, and the task is to modify its structure without modifying the data of the individual nodes.
- **In-place modification**: The modifications to the linked list must be made in place, that is, we’re not allowed to use more than $O(1)$ additional space.

## Heap: Introduction

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{
    latex: (
      <ul>
        <li>\(Find\;Min / Max - O(1)\)</li>
        <li>\(Insert, Remove - O(log(n))\)</li>
        <li>\(Heapify - O(n)\)</li>
      </ul>
    ),
  }}
  sc={{ latex: "$$O(1)$$" }}
/>

Heap is a **complete binary tree** where each node is smaller than its children (for min heap). This property is called **Heap invariant**.

Heap must always comply to **Heap invariant**

#### Priority Queue vs Heap

- Priority queue
  - Abstract data structure (like stack or queue) that behaves like queue (First In, First Out)
  - Specifies behavior of data structure
  - Doesn't define internal implementation
  - Each element has **priority** - the higher propriety element comes first
- Heap
  - Implementation of Priority queue

#### Types

- **Min heap** - each parent node **smaller of equal** to its children
- **Max heap** - each parent node **bigger or equal** to its children

#### Operations on heap

- **Add node**
  1. Add new node to end of heap
  2. Swap the node with parent if it's bigger than parent
  3. At most, $O(log(n))$ swaps could be made since heap - **Complete binary tree**. In complete binary tree, height = `log(n)`
- **Remove node**
  1. Take tree root and remove it from tree
  2. Place last element to root
  3. Swap with children to achieve **Heap invariant**
  4. At most, $O(log(n))$ swaps could be made
- **Heapify**
  1. Start from last leave
  2. If node doesn't satisfy **Heap invariant**, recursively heapify subtree
  3. Move up the tree until the entire tree satisfies the **Heap invariant**
  4. The total amount of swaps is $O(n)$

#### Array representation of Heap

Heap usually represented as array:

- Node<sub>i</sub> stored in array by index `i`
- Node<sub>i</sub> left and right children could be found by index `2 * i` and `2 * i + 1`
- It's convenient to store nodes starting from index `1`

#### Example

- Max heap
- Complete binary tree with height of 2

**Tree** representation:

```py
Level             Tree

  0:                9
                  /   \
  1:             7     8
                /
  2:           5
```

**Array** representation with indices:

```py
        ┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
Value   │ - │ 9 │ 7 │ 8 │ 5 │
        └───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘
Index     0   1   2   3   4
```

  - Operating systems use priority queues (heaps) to manage which process gets CPU time next based on priority levels.
- **Resource allocation**
  - In cloud computing, heaps help distribute resources (like memory or CPU) by maintaining a priority queue of requests from different applications.
- **Machine learning**
  - K-nearest neighbors algorithm uses heaps to efficiently maintain the k closest points during distance calculations and similarity searches.

## Heap: Two heaps

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{ latex: "$$O(n*log(k))$$" }}
  sc={{ latex: "$$O(k)$$" }}
/>

Two heaps approach used to find out middle of moving dataset

- <ProblemBadge difficulty="Hard" /> [295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/)
- <ProblemBadge difficulty="Hard" /> [480. Sliding Window Median](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/description/)

It assumes having

- **Max heap** to store maximum of part of dataset
- **Min heap** to store minimum of part of dataset

#### Algorithm for finding **median** of `k`-size dataset

- **Initialization** - placing elements to heaps by $O(k*log(k))$
  1. Initialize **min heap** and **max heap**
     - **Min heap** will store elements right to the median (bigger)
     - **Max heap** will store elements left to the median (smaller)
  2. Place every item in **min heap**
  3. If **min heap** size exceeds `k // 2`
     - Pop element from **min heap** (it will be smallest one)
     - Place to **max heap**
- **Find median** - $O(1)$
  - `k` even - Average of **min heap** and **max heap** roots
  - `k` odd - **Max heap** root
- **Shift sliding window**
  - Perform steps **2-3**

#### When to use

- **Linear data**: The input data is linear but not sorted
- **Stream of data**
- **Find Max / Min**:
  - Find maximums / minimums / maximum and minimum of 2 datasets

 difficulty="Hard"
  example={{
    input: "k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]",
    output: "4",
    explanation: <span>Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.</span>
  }}>

Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at **most k distinct** projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to **maximize** its total capital after finishing at **most k distinct** projects.

You are given `n` projects where the <code>i<sub>th</sub></code> project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your **total capital**.

Pick a list of at most `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize** your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is **even**, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.

- For examples, if <code>arr = [2,<u>3</u>,4]</code>, the median is `3`.
- For examples, if <code>arr = [1,<u>2,3</u>,4]</code>, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. There is a **sliding window** of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the **median** array for each window in the original array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

## Heap: K-Way Merge

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{ latex: "$$O(n*log(k))$$" }}
  sc={{ latex: "$$O(k)$$" }}
/>

The **K-way merge** pattern combines **k** sorted data structures into a single **sorted** output.

It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from among the first elements of each input list and adding it to the output list, continuing until all elements are merged in order.

K-way merge of sorted data could be achieved by:

- **Heaps**
- **Merge sort**

**Min Heap Approach**:

1. Insert first element from each list into min heap
2. Remove heap's top element, add to output
3. Replace with next element from same input list
4. Repeat until all elements merged

**Divide & Merge (merge sort)**:

1. Divide lists into 2 parts and merge each part
2. Continue dividing and merging resulting lists
3. Repeat until single sorted list remains

## Heap: Top K Elements

<AlgorithmSummary
  tc={{ latex: "$$O(n*log(n))$$" }}
  sc={{ latex: "$$O(k)$$" }}
/>

The `top k` elements pattern is crucial for efficiently finding a specific number of elements, `k`, from a dataset.

Maintain a `heap` of size `k` while iterating through the list of elements

#### Time Complexity

Without this pattern, sorting the whole collection is $O(n*log(n))$, plus $O(k)$ to pick **top k** elements. The **top k** pattern achieves $O(n*log(k))$ by selectively tracking compared elements, using a **heap**.

#### Using Heap

A heap is ideal for managing the smallest or largest **k elements**. By using a max heap for smallest elements and a min heap for largest, we can maintain ordered elements with quick access to the smallest or largest.

#### Operating Procedure

1. Insert first k elements into the appropriate heap.
   - Min heap for largest elements.
   - Max heap for smallest elements.
2. For remaining elements:
   - In min heap (for largest elements), replace the smallest (top) with any found larger element.
   - In max heap (for smallest elements), replace the largest (top) with any found smaller element.

#### Efficiency

**Time complexity** of Top K approach using heap:

- $O(log(k))$ - insertions and removals
- $O(n*log(k))$ - processing all elements
- $O(k*log(k))$ - retrieving all `k` elements, due to reorganization after each removal.

**Time complexity comparison**

**n** - number of all items. **k** - top k elements

- Brute force - $O(n^2)$
- Sorting - $O(n * log(n))$
- Heap - $O(n * log(k))$

#### Typical problems

- <ProblemBadge difficulty="Easy" /> [703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/description/)
- <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [767. Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/description/)
- <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/)

#### When to use

- **Unsorted List Analysis**: Task involves extracting a specific subset (largest, smallest, most/least frequent) from an unsorted list, either as the final goal or an intermediate step.
- **Identifying a Specific Subset**: To identify a subset based on criteria like **top k**, <code>k<sub>th</sub> largest/smallest</code>, or **k most frequent**, indicating the top k elements pattern is a fit.

#### How to identify Top K pattern

- Top k element
- Smallest / Biggest element
- Most / Least frequent k elements
- Furthest / Nearest
- Given Unsorted data

#### Pitfalls

- Sometimes mathematical approach faster
- Sometimes other patterns faster: [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/)
  - [Quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect) - Average Time Complexity $O(n)$
  - Heap - Average Time Complexity $O(n \times \log k)$
- If data is sorted, use **binary search** or others
- If need to find one extremum, heap is not needed

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2)`.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

## Binary search

<AlgorithmSummary tc={{ latex: "$$O(\\log n)$$" }} sc={{ latex: "$$O(1)$$" }} />

**Binary search** - search algorithm in sorted array

1. It works by repeatedly **dividing the search interval in half**.
   1. If the target value is **less than** the middle element, the search continues in the left half;
   2. if greater, it continues in the right half.
2. This process is repeated until the target is found or the interval is empty.

Simple implementation

```py filename="Binary search - Iterative"
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found at index mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Discard the left half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Discard the right half

    return -1  # Target not found
```

#### Modified Binary search

- Modification of Binary search
- Applies specific conditions or transformations to address unique problems:

1. **Binary Search on a Modified Array**: Array is altered
   - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
     \- sorted and then rotated.
2. **Binary Search with Multiple Requirements**: Adapt the **comparison** logic to meet multiple conditions:
   - Finding a range of targets
   - Identifying the leftmost or rightmost occurrences of a value.
3. **Finding Conditions**: Identify boundary conditions
   - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Easy" /> [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)
     \- locating the first instance that meets a specific criterion.

These modifications allow binary search to efficiently tackle a broader range of problems.

#### When to use

- Time Complexity constraint - $ O(\log n) $
- Linear data structure with **random access**
- Data is **sorted**
- Data structure that supports **direct addressing**: array, matrix
- There's **no linear data structure**, but data is in **sorted** order
  - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Easy" /> [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

#### Challenges using B-Search

- Identify pattern
- Find proper condition
- Not to fall into infinite loop

#### Notes

- Pre-processing might be needed
  - Sort if collection is unsorted
  - Precompute if needed
    - <ProblemBadge difficulty="Medium" /> [162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
      - Precompute cumulative sum
- Sometimes we don't want to check found element in loop

```py filename="Internal bisect.py module - bisect_left function"
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        if a[mid] < x:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            hi = mid
    return lo
```

- Beware overflow:

```py
  mid = left + (right - left) // 2
  # vs
  mid = (right + left) // 2
```

- Sometimes we can use built-in b-search like `bisect_left` in Python
- Infinite loop:

```py
  while l <= r:
    ...
    l = mid
```

  title="162. Find Peak Element"

  example={{
    input: "nums = [1,2,3,1]",

    explanation: "3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2."
  }}
>

A **peak element** is an element that is **strictly greater** than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(\log n)$ time.

## Dynamic Programming

**Dynamic programming** is a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution.

#### Why use DP?

- The problem can be divided by subproblems
- The subproblems are overlapping

#### 3 main components:

1. **State** - stores answer for i-th subproblem
2. **Transition between states** - how to get new solution based on previously calculated
3. **Base case**

#### Approaches

- **Top-Down** - try to solve main problem first, and to solve it solve subproblems recursively up to base case
- **Bottom-Up** - solve subproblems starting from the next one to base case and finishing on main problem

- **Push DP** - update future states based on the current state
- **Pull DP** - calculate the current state based on past states

#### Top-Down vs Bottom-Up

**Top-Down**

- Benefits: Easier to implement because of recursion
- Drawbacks: Could not be appliciable because of call stack overflow

**Bottom-Up**

- Benefits: No recursion. Sometimes is better in space than Top-Down
- Drawbacks: Harder to implement

#### Hints on using DP

- Think of Base case
- First try recursive Top-Bottom
- Then if Top-Bottom doesn't fit (because of recursive stack or to optimise space, or whatsoever) then try Bottom-Up
